# Network
Network is a social network website that functions much like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) but has a frontend design similar to Twitter and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) combined. Django is the main web framework used for this project.

## Overview
Network is the foruth project for Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. The project specifications are listed [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/).

### Project Demos
